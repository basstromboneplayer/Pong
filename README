- Added Socket Handler class. The server can accept the following commands (and can be extended to accept more):
	'FILE' - returns request file to client
	'LIST' - returns an asset list in the form of a dictionary
	'DATA' - Currently returns the client packet. This can be extended to pass game state info.
			- All other requests return an 'ignoring request' error

- Added 3 Methods of downloading assets and each method is activated by setting 'download_method' equal to one of the following:
	# 0 - Download each asset individually
	# 1 - Download a zip file and extract assets
	# 2 - Download an asset list and download each asset as needed

- Added the following functions

	def download_asset_list(s):
		# retrieves an asset list
	def download_file(s,filename):
		# downloads a given file
	def unzip_file(filename):
		# unzips a given zip file
	def clean_dir():
		# removes all previously downloaded assets

- Remember to run the server first
